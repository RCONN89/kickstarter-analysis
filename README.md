# KickStarter Analysis for Louise
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to help Louise figure out the best time of year to start her Kickstarter and how much money she can expect to get based on goal for her play, *Fever*
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
According to our data it looks like the best time to launch Louise's Kickstarter would be between May and June.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The data shows pretty clearly that the less money you ask for the more likely you'll get it, and as long as you ask for less than $15000, you have a more than 50% chance of succeeding. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I'm skeptical about whether or not the data based on launch date is telling us anything useful. For the most part, the successful kickstarters seem to be trending similarly throughout the year as failed kickstarters.
## Results
Based on the data collected and analyzed, I think *Fever* has the best chance of succeeding if the Kickstarter is launched in May and no more than $10,000 is requested. The beginning and end of year should be avoided. Rather than looking at whether or not the Kickstarter successful or not I would like to look at a graph that just showed how much money a Kickstarter received, because even if a play wasn't successful but still brought in $40,000, that would be a success to us if we were only looking for $2000.
